**Last Updated:** September 12, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Litmus AI ("we," "our," or "us"). Our mission is to provide an AI-powered tool to help users analyze the credibility of online content. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and handle your information when you use our web application and associated services (like our WhatsApp bot).

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information in a few different ways to provide and improve our service.

#### **Information You Provide to Us:**

* **Account Information:** When you sign up and authenticate using our provider, Clerk, we receive your email address and any other profile information (like your name or profile picture) that you consent to share.
* **Content for Analysis:** We collect the URLs, text, and/or images that you submit to our service for the explicit purpose of running our analysis pipeline.
* **WhatsApp Phone Number:** If you choose to link your account to our WhatsApp bot, we will collect and store your WhatsApp phone number to associate it with your account and deliver analysis results.

#### **Information We Collect Automatically:**

* **Usage Data:** Like most web services, we may collect standard log data, including your IP address, browser type, and the dates and times you access our service. This is used for security, debugging, and improving our service.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

Our use of your information is strictly limited to providing and improving the Litmus AI service.

* **To Provide the Service:** The primary use of your submitted content is to run it through our analysis pipeline, which involves communicating with third-party AI and search services.
* **To Personalize Your Experience:** If you are logged in, we use your account information to provide you with access to your personal analysis history.
* **To Communicate With You:** We use your email address to send authentication codes (OTPs) to link your WhatsApp account and your WhatsApp number to deliver analysis results.
* **To Improve Our System:** We may use anonymized content and analysis results to improve the quality and accuracy of our AI models and caching systems.

## 4. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal data. However, to operate our service, we must share certain information with trusted third-party providers:

* **AI & Search Providers:** The content you submit for analysis is sent to third-party services like the Vercel AI SDK (which may use models from Google, OpenAI, etc.) and the Exa API to perform the analysis.
* **Authentication Provider:** Your authentication is managed by Clerk. We do not handle or store your passwords.
* **Database & Infrastructure Providers:** Our application is hosted on platforms like Vercel, and our data is stored in databases like PostgreSQL (via Vercel Postgres or Supabase) and Pinecone.

## 5. Data Retention & Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information.

Your analysis history is retained to provide you with your personalized dashboard feature. Content that is cached to improve our RAG system is subject to an automated deletion process (e.g., after a set number of days) to ensure our knowledge base remains fresh.
